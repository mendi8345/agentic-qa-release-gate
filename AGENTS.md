# Agent Instructions

## Project

Small .NET 8 API used to practise CI, pull-request workflows, automated testing, and agent-driven development.

## Work style

- Inspect the relevant code and tests before editing.
- For implementation tasks, present a short plan first and wait for approval.
- Keep changes small and limited to the requested behaviour.
- Do not refactor unrelated code or change public API contracts unless requested.
- State assumptions and unresolved questions instead of inventing requirements.

## Validation

Run from the repository root:

- `dotnet restore AgenticQaLab.sln`
- `dotnet build AgenticQaLab.sln --no-restore`
- `dotnet test AgenticQaLab.sln --no-build`

Every behavioural change must include automated tests. Cover the happy path, negative cases, and relevant boundary cases.

## Completion report

Before finishing, report:

- Files changed and why.
- Tests added or changed.
- Commands run and their results.
- Remaining risks or assumptions.
